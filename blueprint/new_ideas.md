# New development ideas

- Add the possibility of rotation of transition dipole moment after a state change.
    - Change the basis set to Wigner D functions
- Add the independent superposition of fast local motion and slow global tumbling.
    - Add a second rotational diffusion process with a certain localization potential
    - Exploit the way it is defined in SRLR (Polimeno/Zerbetto work)
- High NA detection and excitation might require some adjustments to take into account the angle changes.
    - Read again the papers of Fisz (Fisz2005 and Fisz2007)
