# rotational_diffusion_photophysics
Tools for computing time-dependent fluorescence signals with rotational diffusion and complex photophysics.
An arbitrary kinetic scheme can be used and the program analytically solves the diffusion-kinetics problem. All the angular probability distribution functions are expanded with spherical harmonics.
