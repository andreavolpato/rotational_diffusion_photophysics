# rotational_diffusion_photophysics
Tools for computing time-dependent fluorescence signals with rotational diffusion and complex photophysics.
An arbitrary kinetic scheme can be used and the program analytically solves the diffusion-kinetics problem. All the angular probability distribution functions are expanded with spherical harmonics. Supporting the method implementation and findings in the manuscript "Extending fluorescence anisotropy to large complexes
using reversibly switchable proteins", Andrea Volpato, Dirk Ollech, Jonatan Alvelid, Martina Damenti, Barbara MÃ¼ller, Andrew York, Maria Ingaramo, Ilaria Testa (manuscript just-accepted, Nature Biotechnology, 2022).
