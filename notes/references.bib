@article{TeijeiroGonzalez2021,
abstract = {F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a powerful tool to investigate the interaction between proteins in living cells. Fluorescence proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its derivatives, are coexpressed in cells linked to proteins of interest. Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy is a popular tool to study homo-FRET of fluorescent proteins as an indicator of dimerization, in which its signature consists of a very short component at the beginning of the anisotropy decay. In this work, we present an approach to study GFP homo-FRET via a combination of time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, the stretched exponential decay model, and molecular dynamics simulations. We characterize a new, to our knowledge, FRET standard formed by two enhanced GFPs (eGFPs) and a flexible linker of 15 aminoacids (eGFP15eGFP) with this protocol, which is validated by using an eGFP monomer as a reference. An excellent agreement is found between the FRET efficiency calculated from the fit of the eGFP15eGFP fluorescence anisotropy decays with a stretched exponential decay model (〈EFRETexp〉 = 0.25 ± 0.05) and those calculated from the molecular dynamics simulations (〈EFRETMD〉 = 0.18 ± 0.14). The relative dipole orientation between the GFPs is best described by the orientation factors 〈$\kappa$2〉 = 0.17 ± 0.16 and 〈|$\kappa$|〉 = 0.35 ± 0.20, contextualized within a static framework in which the linker hinders the free rotation of the fluorophores and excludes certain configurations. The combination of time- and polarization-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations is shown to be a powerful tool for the study and interpretation of homo-FRET.},

abstract = {In STED (stimulated emission depletion) nanoscopy, the resolution and signal are limited by the fluorophore de-excitation efficiency and photobleaching. Here, we investigated their dependence on the pulse duration and power of the applied STED light for the popular 750 nm wavelength. In experiments with red- and orange-emitting dyes, the pulse duration was varied from the sub-picosecond range up to continuous-wave conditions, with average powers up to 200 mW at 80 MHz repetition rate, i.e. peak powers up to 1 kW and pulse energies up to 2.5 nJ. We demonstrate the dependence of bleaching on pulse duration, which dictates the optimal parameters of how to deliver the photons required for transient fluorophore silencing. Measurements with the dye ATTO647N reveal that the bleaching of excited molecules scales with peak power with a single effective order $\sim$1.4. This motivates peak power reduction while maintaining the number of STED-light photons, in line with the superior resolution commonly achieved for nanosecond STED pulses. Other dyes (ATTO590, STAR580, STAR635P) exhibit two distinctive bleaching regimes for constant pulse energy, one with strong dependence on peak power, one nearly independent. We interpret the results within a photobleaching model that guides quantitative predictions of resolution and bleaching.},

abstract = {Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) serve as markers in advanced fluorescence imaging. Photoswitching from a non-fluorescent off-state to a fluorescent on-state involves trans-to-cis chromophore isomerization and proton transfer. Whereas excited-state events on the ps timescale have been structurally characterized, conformational changes on slower timescales remain elusive. Here we describe the off-to-on photoswitching mechanism in the RSFP rsEGFP2 by using a combination of time-resolved serial crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser and ns-resolved pump–probe UV-visible spectroscopy. Ten ns after photoexcitation, the crystal structure features a chromophore that isomerized from trans to cis but the surrounding pocket features conformational differences compared to the final on-state. Spectroscopy identifies the chromophore in this ground-state photo-intermediate as being protonated. Deprotonation then occurs on the $\mu$s timescale and correlates with a conformational change of the conserved neighbouring histidine. Together with a previous excited-state study, our data allow establishing a detailed mechanism of off-to-on photoswitching in rsEGFP2.},

When expanded to high degree, the accuracy and speed of the spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions are of paramount importance. SHTools is a time and user-tested open-source archive of both Fortran 95 and Python routines for performing spherical harmonic analyses. The routines support all spherical-harmonic normalization conventions used in the geosciences, including 4$\pi$-normalized, Schmidt seminormalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized harmonics, along with the option of employing the Condon-Shortley phase factor of (-1)m. Data on the sphere can be sampled on a variety of grid formats, including equally spaced cylindrical grids and grids appropriate for integration by Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The spherical-harmonic transforms are proven to be fast and accurate for spherical harmonic degrees up to 2800. Several tools are provided for the geoscientist, including routines for performing localized spectral analyses and basic operations related to global gravity and magnetic fields. In the Python environment, operations are very simple to perform as a result of three class structures that encompass all operations on grids, spherical harmonic coefficients, and spatiospectral localization windows.

abstract = {The theory of fluorescence depolarization experiments on many-ground- and many-excited-state species in solution, is presented. In the formalism discussed the state-dependent rotational dynamics of solutes is coupled with the state-to-state kinetic relaxation processes involved. The rotational dynamics of molecules can be different in different excited states due to state-dependent solvation effects (state-dependent solute-solvent interactions) which can modulate the hydrodynamic size and shape of rotating objects. Another reason for the state-dependence of rotational dynamics can be possible changes in the geometries of the solutes in different excited states. Two cases are distinguished: (a) state-dependent geometrical transformations of solutes which do not change the orientation of the principal axes diagonalizing the diffusion tensors in the excited states involved and (b) geometrical transformation of molecules which change the orientation of the principal axes (state-dependent choice for principal axes). It is assumed that in case (b) the change in the molecular geometry is not an extra source for the molecular reorientation or that this effect can be neglected to a first approximation. The case of rigid isotropic systems is considered.},

abstract = {The polarized fluorescence spectroscopy of two-ground and two-excited state systems in solution is discussed. A state-dependent diffusion model for the rotational motion of an asymmetric, symmetric and spherical rotor is considered. Analytic expressions for the polarized fluorescence components in the case of symmetric and spherical diffusors are derived. The absorption and emission transition dipole moments have different directions in the molecule-fixed frames in both ground- and excited-state species. The case of double absorption bands with different directions of absorption dipole moments, in both ground-states species, is discussed. The problem of convolution between the instrument response function with a model decay is also discussed. Two methods for recovering the instrument response function are considered; namely, the scatter method and the method of a monoexponential reference compound. The theory discussed in this work can be employed to many problems important from an experimental point of view e.g., different kinds of excited-state reactions or excitation energy transfer in rigid double-chromophore complexes. Computer generated synthetic decays of polarized fluorescence and emission anisotropy for the one-ground- and two-excited-state problem are exemplified.},

abstract = {Photochromic fluorescent proteins play key roles in super-resolution microscopy and optogenetics. The light-driven structural changes that modulate the fluorescence involve both trans-to-cis isomerization and proton transfer. The mechanism, timescale and relative contribution of chromophore and protein dynamics are currently not well understood. Here, the mechanism of off-to-on-state switching in dronpa is studied using femtosecond-to-millisecond time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and isotope labelling. Chromophore and protein dynamics are shown to occur on multiple timescales, from picoseconds to hundreds of microseconds. Following excitation of the trans chromophore, a ground-state primary product is formed within picoseconds. Surprisingly, the characteristic vibrational spectrum of the neutral cis isomer appears only after several tens of nanoseconds. Further fluctuations in protein structure around the neutral cis chromophore are required to form a new intermediate, which promotes the final proton-transfer reaction. These data illustrate the interplay between chromophore dynamics and the protein environment underlying fluorescent protein photochromism.},

@article{Masullo2018,
abstract = {The theoretically unlimited spatial resolution of fluorescence nanoscopy often comes at the expense of time, contrast and increased dose of energy for recording. Here, we developed MoNaLISA, for Molecular Nanoscale Live Imaging with Sectioning Ability, a nanoscope capable of imaging structures at a scale of 45–65 nm within the entire cell volume at low light intensities (W-kW cm−2). Our approach, based on reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins, features three distinctly modulated illumination patterns crafted and combined to gain fluorescence ON–OFF switching cycles and image contrast. By maximizing the detected photon flux, MoNaLISA enables prolonged (40–50 frames) and large (50 × 50 µm2) recordings at 0.3–1.3 Hz with enhanced optical sectioning ability. We demonstrate the general use of our approach by 4D imaging of organelles and fine structures in epithelial human cells, colonies of mouse embryonic stem cells, brain cells, and organotypic tissues.},

abstract = {Reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins (RSFPs) serve as markers in advanced fluorescence imaging. Photoswitching from a non-fluorescent off-state to a fluorescent on-state involves trans-to-cis chromophore isomerization and proton transfer. Whereas excited-state events on the ps timescale have been structurally characterized, conformational changes on slower timescales remain elusive. Here we describe the off-to-on photoswitching mechanism in the RSFP rsEGFP2 by using a combination of time-resolved serial crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser and ns-resolved pump–probe UV-visible spectroscopy. Ten ns after photoexcitation, the crystal structure features a chromophore that isomerized from trans to cis but the surrounding pocket features conformational differences compared to the final on-state. Spectroscopy identifies the chromophore in this ground-state photo-intermediate as being protonated. Deprotonation then occurs on the $\mu$s timescale and correlates with a conformational change of the conserved neighbouring histidine. Together with a previous excited-state study, our data allow establishing a detailed mechanism of off-to-on photoswitching in rsEGFP2.},

@article{Khatib2016,
abstract = {Phototransformable fluorescent proteins are central to several nanoscopy approaches. As yet however, there is no available variant allowing super-resolution imaging in cell compartments that maintain oxidative conditions. Here, we report the rational design of two reversibly switchable fluorescent proteins able to fold and photoswitch in the bacterial periplasm, rsFolder and rsFolder2. rsFolder was designed by hybridisation of Superfolder-GFP with rsEGFP2, and inherited the fast folding properties of the former together with the rapid switching of the latter, but at the cost of a reduced switching contrast. Structural characterisation of the switching mechanisms of rsFolder and rsEGFP2 revealed different scenarios for chromophore cis-trans isomerisation and allowed designing rsFolder2, a variant of rsFolder that exhibits improved switching contrast and is amenable to RESOLFT nanoscopy. The rsFolders can be efficiently expressed in the E. coli periplasm, opening the door to the nanoscale investigation of proteins localised in hitherto non-observable cellular compartments.},

@article{Nienhaus2016,
abstract = {Proteins of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) family are indispensable for fluorescence imaging experiments in the life sciences, particularly of living specimens. Their essential role as genetically encoded fluorescence markers has motivated many researchers over the last 20 years to further advance and optimize these proteins by using protein engineering. Amino acids can be exchanged by site-specific mutagenesis, starting with naturally occurring proteins as templates. Optical properties of the fluorescent chromophore are strongly tuned by the surrounding protein environment, and a targeted modification of chromophore-protein interactions requires a profound knowledge of the underlying photophysics and photochemistry, which has by now been well established from a large number of structural and spectroscopic experiments and molecular-mechanical and quantum-mechanical computations on many variants of fluorescent proteins. Nevertheless, such rational engineering often does not meet with success and thus is complemented by random mutagenesis and selection based on the optical properties. In this topical review, we present an overview of the key structural and spectroscopic properties of fluorescent proteins. We address protein-chromophore interactions that govern ground state optical properties as well as processes occurring in the electronically excited state. Special emphasis is placed on photoactivation of fluorescent proteins. These light-induced reactions result in large structural changes that drastically alter the fluorescence properties of the protein, which enables some of the most exciting applications, including single particle tracking, pulse chase imaging and super-resolution imaging. We also present a few examples of fluorescent protein application in live-cell imaging experiments.},
